# How to use this for uptool app?
1. `npm install && npm run build_website`
2. Usually we only need to replace the build and keep static files unchanged: replace `/frontend/public/3dviewer/build` in uptool with `/build` here. `/frontend/public/3dviewer/website` in uptool is a copy from `/website` here.
